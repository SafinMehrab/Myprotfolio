            <p>You might saw me jumping, climbing buildings, and stopping trains. But nobody pays me a dime for that
                work.
                That's why I am learning and mastering web development. I will not stop until I become the Web

                <p>They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web developer. I made their website and
                    showed
                    it to them. They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.
